# Webinar: Training Your First Model in PyTorch

Learn the basics of training a simple PyTorch model using a structured and incremental approach. We will use Google Colab and work our way together into building and training a model in PyTorch.

The main goal of this session is to introduce you to the basic building blocks needed for training a model in PyTorch. At the end of it, you should be familiar with PyTorch's key components and how to assemble them together into a working model.

This session offers a brief overview of the content in the first volume of my series of books, "Deep Learning with PyTorch Step-by-Step". You can find it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QR4M768/) (paperback and Kindle) or [Gumroad](https://dvgodoy.gumroad.com/l/pytorch) (PDF).

Open it in Google Colab [TrainingYourFirstModelinPyTorch.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dvgodoy/AnalyticsVidhya_DataHour_PyTorch/blob/main/TrainingYourFirstModelinPyTorch.ipynb).

If you'd rather use a local environment, please follow these steps (assuming you use Anaconda):

- Install GraphViz: https://www.graphviz.org/

- Create a conda environment: `conda create -n pytorch101 pip conda python==3.8.5`

- Activate the conda environment: `conda activate pytorch101`

- Install PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

- Install other packages: `conda install scikit-learn==0.23.2 matplotlib==3.3.2 jupyter==1.0.0 ipywidgets==7.5.1 plotly==4.14.3 -c anaconda`

- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/dvgodoy/AnalyticsVidhya_DataHour_PyTorch.git`

- Start Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
